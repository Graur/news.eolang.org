title: "Introduced 'switch' Object"
author: Graur

Since 0.23.16 version it is possible to use
[`switch`](https://github.com/objectionary/home/blob/master/objects/org/eolang/switch.eo)
object just like this:

```
memory "swordfish" > password

QQ.switch
  *
    password.eq "swordfish"
    "password is correct!"
  *
    password.eq ""
    "empty password is not allowed"
  *
    FALSE
    "password is wrong"
```

Here, `switch` object returns "password is correct!", which is the first true case in this statement.
The `switch` object consists of arrays with arrays of two elements: condition and return value.

If the above parameters are missing, `switch` will return
an `error` object with `msg` as a string message.
